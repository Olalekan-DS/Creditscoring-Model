#It is almost impossible to understand the original dataset due to its complicated system of categories and symbols. 
#Thus, I wrote a small Python script to convert it into a readable CSV file. Several columns are simply ignored, 
#because in my opinion either they are not important or their descriptions are obscure. The selected attributes are:

loan_id, partner_name, days_late, call_contact_status, comment, type, risk, balance_remaining, amount_already_paid
amount_disbursed, num_of_loaninstalled, num_of_ptp_scheduled, loan_status (Value target - Good or Bad Risk)

#Recommended but not available
Age (numeric)- null
Sex (text: male, female) - null
Job (numeric) - null
Housing (text: own, rent, or free) - null
Saving accounts (text - little, moderate, quite rich, rich) - null
Purpose(text: furnitiure, rent, etc) - null
risk (text: Good, bad)
